# User-Management-Backend-with-Express-and-MongoDB
User Registration:

Create a registration route: Set up an endpoint in your Express application that accepts user registration data such as username, email, and password.

Validate Input: Use a validation library like express-validator to validate user input, ensuring that the email is valid, the password meets your criteria, and fields are not empty.

Check for Existing Users: Before creating a new user, check if a user with the same email or username already exists in the database to prevent duplicate registrations.

Hash Password: Hash the user's password using a library like bcrypt before storing it in the database to enhance security.

Create User Document: Create a new user document in your MongoDB database with the user's details, including the hashed password.

User Login:

Create a login route: Set up an endpoint for user login, typically accepting the user's email and password.

Validate Input: Similar to registration, validate user input, ensuring that the email is valid and the password is provided.

Find User: Query your MongoDB database to find the user with the provided email.

Compare Passwords: Use bcrypt to compare the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database. If they match, allow the user to log in; otherwise, deny access.

Generate a Token: Upon successful login, generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate the user for future requests. This token should contain user-specific data and be signed with a secret key.

Return Token: Send the JWT back to the client as part of the login response. The client will typically store this token and include it in future authenticated requests.
